<br>Thread analysis of enTouch driver
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
queue means the thread first puts a command in the queue, then SOME command
from the queue should be issued if the enTouch link is not busy</li>

<li>
retry means a 05.04.06.07 is issued to get the enTouch to resend its last
response</li>

<li>
restart means to send something (usually from queue) regardless of possible
state of enTouch link.</li>
</ul>

<br>polled commands
<p>CardSwipes,PINS and ButtonPresses must be polled. The enTouch NEVER
sends serial data except in response to a command. Our abstract Forms contain
buttons and a swipe enable. When the form is sent to the entouch if it
has buttons then button polling is turned on, if swipe is enabled then
polling for MSR data is enabled. When pinEntry is requested we first cancel
any polling.
<p>However when a form does not have buttons or permit swipes then if it
becomes disconnected we don't know about it. When it is reconnected we
still don't know about it until we try to talk to it. Once we talk to it
and find that its power was off we must send many commands, such as a full
download of all graphics, in case it is a unit that has not been used by
the present version of the application. If it did not power cycle then
we have no problems and are running again.
<p>For the above reason I have in the past chosen to always be talking
to the entouch so that I get early warning of a power cycle and can hopefully
have it redownloaded much sooner. With multiple-terminals we wish to reduce
the burden the enTouch presents to the system and while making those changes
this ability to detect reconnects when they happen regardless of what form
is active will be lost for awhile.
