<h3>
enTouch interface issues</h3>

<h4>
Attributes of the interface</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Polled mode</li>

<br>The enTouch never originates a communication, it must be asked if it
has anything for the host. Therefore communications to it are back-to-back
continuous. As is pertinent to the given form we cycle through "do you
have card info?", "has a button been pressed?", and if neither of those
is relevent then "are you there?".
<li>
Packetized communications</li>

<br>Each command sent to the enTouch starts with a '05', then the length,
then the binary content of the particular message, then a LRC character.
Each reply except for an "are you there" reply (actually called by them
an echo command) starts with a '00' followed by the message length, command
code, status code, possible more data such as card info, LRC character.
<li>
Automatic baud rate detection</li>

<br>The first byte that the enTouch receives after it has done its power-on
self-inspection is used by it to set its baud rate. It expects a '05' and
uses the waveform of that character to compute the baud rate. We need to
defeat that to have a chanc eof reconnecting to it after it spontaneously
power cycles (i.e. cycles without the host being informed in advance).
At present we only know how to do this manually. We can get them from the
factory already set to a fixed baud rate. If we had a working uploading
program we could force all sorts of stuff into them upon receipt, and with
a technical specification for downloading them we could set the parameters
<i>in the field</i> instead of relying upon human based preparation procedures.
<li>
Binary data stream</li>

<br>Data sent is binary encoded. This is relevent because it means that
the data part of a message can contain ANY values, including those used
for automatic baud rate detection and start of packet.
<br>All other binary protocols I have ever read about, much less directly
encountered, either DON'T ALLOW THIS, or have a special signal outside
of the byte stream to reset the terminal, such as a "break". Most binary
protocols have an 'escape mechanism' that translates any embedded data
that looks like a framing character to a character sequence that can be
reconverted to the original data after the framing is stripped by the packet
receiver. There is nothing in the documents we have received suggesting
that there is any form of protocol reset, and a specific request to Jim
Roberts asking about some possible undocumented restart facility went unanswered.</ol>

<h4>
Problems that might occur</h4>

<ol>
<li>
power cycle</li>

<br>The next successful communication will tell us that a power cycle occured.
At that time we could choose to resend initialization commands. Unfortunately
while autobaud is enabled data that we are sending (when we haven't yet
figured out that the unit died) might get misinterpreted as baud rate setting
info locking the enTouch into an unknown baud rate.
<br><font size=-2>As an aside, we send our forms (especially graphics)
every time our program starts as we cannot determine what forms are saved
on the unit. Perhaps we could add a maintenance function that even clerks
can invoke to "download CAT". This would reduce wear on the flash memory,
speed up the bootup process, which would simplify responding to this event.</font>
<li>
cable disconnect</li>

<br>We can only detect the shell coming off the back of the unit (via loss
of handshake loopback) and maybe not even that when we start using a multi-port
card. We cannot directly detect problems at the terminal or RCB. A cable
loss from the RCB is usually going to result in a power cycle.
<li>
bad packet sent</li>

<br>The enTouch will not respond to a bad packet until a good one follows
it. The good one gets a reply that there was a bad packet received. This
is empirical info, the manual does not talk about error processing. (confirmed
via email)
<li>
bad packet received</li>

<br>The received packet can be malformed. A received packet can have a
status code that implies that the command just sent (or sometimes the one
before that) wasn't received properly at the unit. If I do a "<a href="#Resend last response command">resend
last response</a>" when a command times out then we lose the ambiguity
of which command might be the one that failed. Like the enTouch itself
we cannot respond to a bad incoming packet until the expected number of
bytes has been received else we might misinterpret the incoming data as
an attempt to start the next reply. This is due to the bad design of the
protocol, the part about the "start of frame" possibly appearing in the
middle of data.
<li>
our program sends an ABORT command</li>

<br>If we send one of these without following it up with all sorts of configuring
commands then the terminal goes blank and stays blank. I mention this so
that I remember to check our code for sending it. I think we do with each
form change that we invoke. If the following form change commands fail
then the terminal would stay blank.</ol>
Features of the ET1K that I have never invoked:
<ol>
<li>
<a NAME="Resend last response command"></a>"Resend last response" command</li>

<br>[done, didn't need to do the massive rework as a 'resend' when the
entouch has just started yields a distinctive response]<strike>To use this
I would want to do rework on my reply processor to make it "reply-per-command
<b>type"</b>, rather then the present "reply to the point where the command
was sent". Now that I have a global view of our usage of the device, this
per-type approach would be a beneficial change to program HOWEVER it will
take time on the order of a day to implement. In java terms I change the
jpos service to not just have "event listeners" but to have a "CardListener"
and a "SignatureListener" and a "ButtonListener" and a "PIN listener" and
a "HorridThingHappenedListener", the latter including such things as "device
seems to have spontaneously powered on" and "device has timed out and first
retry failed".</strike>
<li>
<a NAME="Reset terminal command"></a>"Reset terminal" command.</li>

<br>From the manual:
<br><tt>Function code 09 causes the Signature Capture Peripheral to reset
itself.</tt>
<br><tt>The effect of this command on the peripheral is the same as if
the unit were powered off and then back on. It can be issued, for example,
by the host application as part of its start-of-day procedure. Function
code 09 can also be issued when the unit is not functioning properly. All
software in the peripheral is reinitialized when the unit is reset, which
may help in eliminating a problem in the software. Note that the peripheral
sends the host a response message before it resets itself. Upon reset,
the NCR 5992 Signature Capture Peripheral takes approximately 7 seconds
to perform internal diagnostics, initialize its software, and clear the
screen before it is ready to process host messages.</tt>
<br>This is fairly ludicrous. Given the failure modes we seem to encounter
you can't reliably send messages...there must be more horrible things that
can happen with a unit, to justify this command's existence.</ol>
