The rules for enTouch artwork are as follows:
<ol>
<li>
single bit plane</li>

<li>
exactly 320 pixels across, and we mean exactly.</li>

<li>
maximum 200 lines vertically</li>

<li>
if less than 200 lines they will run from the top of the screen downwards&nbsp;<br>
<font size=-2>(note: seems like it should be 240, need to check the reality
against the documents we have. It may be that there 240 lines of storage
but only 200 show.)</font></li>

<li>
the active area of buttons are on the chracter grid which is 40 by 30 (8
by 8 cells)</li>

<li>
dynamic content is non graphical, must be on the grid and comes in 4 fonts
with three attributes:</li>

<ol>
<li>
8X8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (kinda small)</li>

<li>
8X8 Bold (still smallish)</li>

<li>
8X16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (double high, fairly wierd)</li>

<li>
16X16&nbsp; (most legible)</li>

<li>
underlined (often visually merges with the next text line)</li>

<li>
italic</li>

<li>
reversed (you will need a space character at the beginning of a reversed
block to make the first char look ok)</li>
</ol>

<li>
Vertical text will have to be negotiated with the engineers, each letter
has to been sent as a separate text item, probably not much of an issue
now that I think about it, a few hours work.</li>

<li>
buttons are outlined one pixel within the character cell bounds. You can
NOT turn off the drawing of the rectangle. The rectangle is transparent.</li>

<li>
we can have "radio" buttons, ones that enforce only one at a time selected.</li>

<li>
there is a limit of 8 buttons on the screen at one time. This limit is applied
to the sum of all types of buttons.

<li>
it can take 10 to 15 seconds the first time to put up a form that has
graphics. paymate's rendition of a jpos driver shares common graphics,
only uploading once.

</li>
</ol>

<p><br>We would prefer to generate forms via lines of programming than
to have them statically entered. This is to ensure easy and accurate coordination
of static components and dynamic ones. As the program matures we will make
it easy to sketch something and have a program convert it into a program.
A form needs to be broken down into a graphic background, button locations,
(dynamic) text locations with font info, and what the function of each
button is to be.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The text that follows is a revision marker for our version control system.
Get used to seeing them on all of our documents.
