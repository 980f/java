/**
 * Title:        $Source: /home/andyh/localcvs/pmnet/cvs/src/net/paymate/util/Waiter.java,v $
 * Description:  properly synchronized wait/notify mechanism
 * Copyright:    Copyright (c) 2001
 * Company:      PayMate.net
 * @author PayMate.net
 * @version $Revision: 1.21 $
 * usage:
 * call waiter.prepare() BEFORE triggering behavior that will eventually notify you.
 * call waiter.Start(...) to wait for notification. It returns "state" or you can get
 * that same value from the state() function.
 * All parameters are set by prepare(...) variations, internal defaults used for ones omitted
 * Start(...) variations only modify the parameters passed, retaining ones set by the last prepare()
 *
 * see end of file for more extensive usage advice
 *
 * NOTE: JVM requires that we synch on the same object that is used for wait and notify!

  '...' stands for the code that triggers the notify that we are waiting upon
  args stands for the wait time, allow interrupt, debugger values used by run()


usage 1: know wait arguments before trigger event:
prepare(args) ... run()

usage 2: know some wait arguments only after trigger event, such as when some
return value from the trigger code is needed to compute a wait time.
prepare() ... Start(args)

usage 3: args never change
use static Create() function

prepare() ... run()
