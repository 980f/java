   *
   * MMM: This is old documentation, but still interesting.
   * It is no longer restricted to a block of text (as the stream functions indicate).
   *
   * There is no reason to provide a system that will be *highly* secure,
   * as the algorithm is right here in decompilable code!
   *
   * For greater security, use the java-provided key-exchange encryption techniques.
   *
   *
   *  crypt - in place encryption/decryption of a buffer
   *
   *      1.  The encryption had to be inexpensive, both in terms of speed and space.
   *
   *      2.  The system needed to be secure against all but the most determined of attackers.
   *
   *  For encryption of a block of data, one calls crypt passing
   *  a pointer to the data block and its length. The data block is
   *  encrypted in place, that is, the encrypted output overwrites
   *  the input.  Decryption is totally isomorphic, and is performed
   *  in the same manner by the same routine.
   *
   *  Before using this routine for encrypting data, you are expected
   *  to specify an encryption key.  This key is an arbitrary string,
   *  to be supplied by the user.  To set the key takes two calls to
   *  crypt().  First, you call
   *
   *      crypt(NULL, vector)
   *
   *  This resets all internal control information.  Typically (and
   *  specifically in the case on MICRO-emacs) you would use a "vector"
   *  of 0.  Other values can be used to customize your editor to be
   *  "incompatible" with the normally distributed version.  For
   *  this purpose, the best results will be obtained by avoiding
   *  multiples of 95.
   *
   *  Then, you "encrypt" your password by calling
   *
   *      crypt(pass, strlen(pass))
   *
   *  where "pass" is your password string.  Crypt() will destroy
   *  the original copy of the password (it becomes encrypted),
   *  which is good.  You do not want someone on a multiuser system
   *  to peruse your memory space and bump into your password.
   *  Still, it is a better idea to erase the password buffer to
   *  defeat memory perusal by a more technical snooper.
   *
   *  For the interest of cryptologists, at the heart of this
   *  function is a Beaufort Cipher.  The cipher alphabet is the
   *  range of printable characters (' ' to '~'), all "control"
   *  and "high-bit" characters are left unaltered.
   *
   *  The key is a variant autokey, derived from a weighted sum
   *  of all the previous clear text and cipher text.  A counter
   *  is used as salt to obliterate any simple cyclic behavior
   *  from the clear text, and key feedback is used to assure
   *  that the entire message is based on the original key,
   *  preventing attacks on the last part of the message as if
   *  it were a pure autokey system.
   *
   *  Overall security of encrypted data depends upon three
   *  factors:  the fundamental cryptographic system must be
   *  difficult to compromise; exhaustive searching of the key
   *  space must be computationally expensive; keys and plaintext
   *  must remain out of sight.  This system satisfies this set
   *  of conditions to within the degree desired for MicroEMACS.
   *
   *  Though direct methods of attack (against systems such as
   *  this) do exist, they are not well known and will consume
   *  considerable amounts of computing time.  An exhaustive
   *  search requires over a billion investigations, on average.
   *
   *  The choice, entry, storage, manipulation, alteration,
   *  protection and security of the keys themselves are the
   *  responsibility of the user.
