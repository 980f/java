 * Synch's were removed as being gratuitous protection against ridiculous activity.
 * If a particular instance is CONTROLLED by different threads then behavior is
 * already impossible to make any good sense out of. The only remaining reason to
 * Synch is to ensure that "long" is atomic. That can be done by multiple reads at
 * far less expense than locks
 * Synch'ing is only needed for non-atomic data that might get written while it is being read.
 * @todo: add registry so that we can do the same adjustments done by Alarmer. (true for anything that uses DateX)
