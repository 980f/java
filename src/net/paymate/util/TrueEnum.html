The TrueEnum'eration facility is an attempt to get compile time type
checking for abstract enumerations. Java abuses the word "enumeration"
to label an abstract indexing of a set of objects. For the rest of this
document 'enumeration' means "giving distinct labels to".


<p> The distinct but abstract integral values for an enumeration
are in a class that extends class TrueEnum. When a text version of a
value is required java's reflection mechanism is used to create a table
of strings indexed by the class's integer members. The rest of the
extension is a generated set of constructors.



<p> TrueEnum's Value() member should only be used when Java mandates an
actual integer. It exists for the sake of efficient <tt>switch </tt>
implementation. All the case labels of a switch(te.Value()) should be of
the form SomeClassEnum.label, where all "SomeClassEnum" tags are
identical across the cases. This is one place where type checking cannot
be done.
