How To use the DBProfiler outside of PayMate.net's library to input into Excel:

[These instructions assume that you have the latest JDK from sun installed on your system.]

0) You must have the informix jdbc drivers installed on your system, or at least the jar to run ifxjdbc from.  Note the location where I put it on my system in step 1.  You can put it wherever you want, but you will probably have to point to it from the commandline's -cp switch.  If you don't have the ifxjdbc.jar, you can get it from informix, or I can email it to you.  See Contact Info below.
1) Run it from the jar and output to a file (for import into Excel):
  java -cp c:\temp\DBProfiler.jar;c:\jdk1.3\jre\lib\ext\ifxjdbc.jar DBProfiler 208.58.21.51:8080 mainsail mainsail mainsail 1strauss > excel.txt
2) Import the CSV file into Excel (Office 2000, at least):
  A) Open Excel.
  B) Create a new (blank) sheet.
  C) From the 'Data' menu, choose 'Get External Data', 'Import Text File'.
  D) Choose the file that you created in step 1 (eg: excel.txt).
  E) Set the 'Type' to 'Delimited' & click [Next].
  F) Set the 'Delimiter' to 'Comma' and the 'Text Qualifier' to '{None}', then click [Finish] and tell Excel where to place the table in your spreadsheet, if it asks.
  G) Format the resulting spreadsheet to your liking.  Delete the Nullable column now, if you don't want it.  You may also want to shrink the font, etc. now.
3) Inserting the spreadsheet into Word for columnating:
  A) Open word and create a new document.
  B) In Excel, click the top-left box (empty) and choose 'Copy' from the 'Edit' menu.
  C) In word, click in the document and choose 'Paste' from the 'Edit' menu.
  D) You can now shrink the font more, shrink the margins, create columns, etc., so that the printout will look nice for you.
4) Note: The actual list of parameters can be shown if you run it with no parameters:
  java -cp c:\temp\DBProfiler.jar;c:\jdk1.3\jre\lib\ext\ifxjdbc.jar DBProfiler

How to package up the java files into a jar for distribution:
1) Copy DBProfiler.java, DatabaseProfile.java, TableProfile.java, and ColumnProfile.java to a temporary directory, and open a dos shell to that directory.
2) Edit each one, removing the "package net.paymate.database" line (or comment it out with //).  (I may have done this already, but just in case, you should check.)
3) Compile them all:
  javac -classpath . ColumnProfile.java TableProfile.java DatabaseProfile.java DBProfiler.java
4) Jar them:
  jar -cf DBProfiler.jar ColumnProfile.class TableProfile.class DatabaseProfile.class DBProfiler.class
