cm3000 keypad+ display as a user interface
<br>technical description
<p>There is a question which contains a prompt and an answer. The keybaord
handler has an input buffer which is separate from the question's answer.
The input buffer can be preloaded or not preloaded. The input buffer can
also be empty or not empty.
<p>Questions are answered by sending them to an answer listener:
<pre>public interface AnswerListener {
&nbsp; public void onReply(Question beingAsked, int opcode);
&nbsp; //opcode values:
&nbsp; public final static int CANCELLED=-1; //escaped or such
&nbsp; public final static int HELPME&nbsp;&nbsp; = 0; //tool tip desired
&nbsp; public final static int SUBMITTED= 1; //enter w/ change
&nbsp; public final static int ACCEPTED = 2; //enter on default
&nbsp; }
//$Id: AnswerListener.java,v ...

</pre>

<hr>pre-loading
<p>the present value of an answer is preloaded into the data entry buffer
whenever the prompt is displayed, which occurs when a quesiton is handed
to the cm3000ui or when CLEAR is pressed and there is input data that is
not preloaded.&nbsp;
<hr>Enter key
<p>The inputbuffer is compared to the question's incoming answer value.
The question's answer then gets the new data but the AnswerListener gets
a flag saying whether the data actually changed (SUBMITTED for data that
changed, ACCEPTED when the data stays the same).&nbsp;
<hr>CLEAR key
<p>If the input buffer is not preloaded then display the prompt and preload
the buffer
<br>else we CANCEL the question.&nbsp;
<hr>backspace
<p>If there is data in the buffer (preload ignored) then we delete the
trailing letter
<br>Else we preload, without presenting the prompt.
<p>This means that if you backspace one more time than there are letters
you suddenly get the default value in your face. This is different than
CLEAR so that we can choose which we prefer, which can include both behaviors.&nbsp;
<hr>ALPHA key
<p>If the input buffer is preloaded then usually the prompt is showing
and pressing alpha replaces the prompt with the preload value
<br>else the last character of the input buffer is shifted
<br>unless the buffer is empty in which case we display an asinine string
as a place holder for some other future feature.
