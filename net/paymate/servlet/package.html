I believe this is a rational plan.

Then this is the spec I will use until I get further notice:

Sessions begun from our client application will not be monitored for
inactivity by the server.  However, the client application will be required
to logout+in on a roughly 24-hour period.  This means that after a terminal
has been logged in for 24 hours, it will be automatically logged out.

This ensures that we do certain kinds of cleanup at the server side, and also
ensures that stale sessions do not remain alive forever.  This also means
that we do NOT have to spam the server with "I'm alive" messages all the
time.

Sessions begun from a browser will be monitored for inactivity and
disconnected after either 5 minutes of inactivy or after two hours of
connectivity, with activity.

Any problems with that?

 I got told emphatically NO when I suggested we would log out the clerk
 after perhap s15 minutes of no activity, we want transactions
 to be instanteous even when the terminal has been idle, and them not to
 have to "unlock" the terminal with extra keystrokes. We'll
 have to try the feel of this to know for sure what we should do.

 I can locally make them reenter a password while separately keeping the
 server link hot to go. As long as they don't have to
 re-enter their ID code as well that should not be so bad. I see this all
 the time at real cash register-checkout stands.

 The terminal can be stroking the server every now and then to keep the
 session alive and pick up any configuration changes, but we
 don't want that spamming any permanent server log.
 When debugging a problem over the phone it would be nice to easily get to
 the time of last contact and what that contact was.
