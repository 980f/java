* Title:        TimeBomber
* Description:  Intended use: timeout on background activity outside of Java
*      set a timebomb ticking, when it blows it calls your function.
*      defuse() it if the desired event happens in a timely fashion.
*      int is used for timer so that we don't have to worry about non-atomicity
*      of longs.
